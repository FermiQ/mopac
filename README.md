The repository is the starting point for an open-source version of the Molecular Orbital PACkage (MOPAC),
which has been closed-source software since 2006. Jimmy Stewart of Stewart Computational Chemistry presently holds the
copyright for this software, and any matters of distribution and licensing should be addressed to him. We have his
permission to begin transitioning the software to an open-source development model to continue the code's development
when he retires, and we are doing so in private until we have established a legal transfer of IP.

I'm moving the code to a git repository now because I need to start testing CMake compilation in multiple computing
environments, which necessitates proper version control. I was going to dump the entire MOPAC archive into this repository,
but it is ~200 MB in size, which is a bit unweildy for GitHub, and it contains copyrighted materials. I will move important
files into this  repository as I continue to organize the contents of the archive and decide how they should be preserved
and propagated into the open-source version. The archive contains a mix of source code, documentation, reference data,
copies of journal articles (that we do not have copyrights for), input/output files, various utility programs and scripts,
and MOPAC Windows executables.
