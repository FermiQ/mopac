=====================
Contributing to MOPAC
=====================

MOPAC is an open source project and, as such, contributions are welcome and appreciated.
The standard, minimal legal stipulations apply: all contributions must be provided under
the LGPL 3.0 license and all contributors must agree to the DCO by using their real name
and a valid email address in their git commit statements.

How to contribute
=================

The preferred method is to fork the project on `GitHub <https://github.com/openmopac/MOPAC/>`_,
make your changes starting from the master branch, and then create a pull request.
MOPAC does not presently have strong stylistic or structural requirements, but
contributions are encouraged to conform to the existing codebase as much as possible.

While not a strict requirement, contributions should pass all available tests,
either as they are or with their reference outputs adjusted with an explanation
for why they needed to be adjusted. Contributions may be delayed or rejected if they
fail a test in a meaningful way that is not straightforward to correct.

What to contribute
==================

Many types of contributions, including non-software, are welcome:

- bug reports (preferably with a representative example)
- new tests
- new features
- performance improvements
- code quality improvements
- feature requests

Attribution
===========

Contributors are welcome to add their names to the `AUTHORS.rst` file as part
of their pull request if they are not already listed as a contributor.
Affiliations at the time of the contribution can be included if desired.
For major contributions, a brief summary of the contribution can also be included.
